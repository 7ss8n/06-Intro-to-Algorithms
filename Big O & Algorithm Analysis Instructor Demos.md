**Objectives**

• To understand why algorithm analysis is important.

• To be able to use &quot;Big-O&quot; to describe execution time.

• To understand the &quot;Big-O&quot; execution time of common operations on Python lists and dictionaries.

• To understand how the implementation of Python data impacts algorithm analysis.

• To understand how to benchmark simple Python programs.
